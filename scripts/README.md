# Pre-release smoke runners

Two scripts live here. Both target the running MCP server's HTTP transport
via the official `mcp` Python SDK; they are part of the pre-release ritual
documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Wire-compatible with any Zabbix MCP
deployment, but the canonical target is the `Wiki-topics` test instance
(`https://student-postgresql-01.initmax.cz`).

## `test_all_tools.py` - synthetic CRUD coverage

Calls every tool listed by `tools/list` with hand-crafted minimal arguments
derived from sample IDs probed up front. Read-only tools (`*_get`,
`*_export`, ...) get `output=extend` queries; write tools get a
parent-before-child create / update / delete lifecycle. Reports pass /
fail / skip per tool to a markdown file.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/test_all_tools.py \
  --token "<bearer>" \
  --server "Wiki-topics" \
  --report tools_test_report.md
```

What it catches: schema drift between Zabbix versions, ordering bugs in
the wrapper, broken `_make_tool_handler` glue, output normalisation
issues. What it does **not** catch: anything that depends on how an LLM
reads the tool description (see below).

## `test_with_llm.py` - real-LLM driven coverage

Drives the MCP server through OpenAI's Chat Completions API. For each of
~28 realistic operator scenarios ("List the first 5 hosts being
monitored", "Walk through this full CRUD lifecycle"), the LLM picks tools
from a curated bucket and chains them; we validate the final answer is
not a refusal and that no tool returned `isError: true`.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/test_with_llm.py \
  --token "<bearer>" \
  --server "Wiki-topics" \
  --model "gpt-4o" \
  --report llm_smoke_report.md
```

OpenAI key is read from `[admin.ai].api_key` in the running server's
config (override with `--openai-key` or by editing `--config`). One full
run on `gpt-4o` is roughly $0.50 and takes 5-10 minutes.

What it catches: tool description / UX bugs that fool LLMs even when the
synthetic runner passes. v1.26 caught that the original `CREATE_PARAMS`
description lacked the explicit `{"params": {...}}` wrap example, which
made gpt-4o-mini fail every write call before the description fix landed.

## Pre-release ritual (recap)

Both runners must report green before tagging a release. Plus the OS
matrix:

```bash
cd tests/installer && ./run_all.sh   # 18 distros, ~30 min on first run
```

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the `feedback_release_checklist` memory for the
full checklist.
